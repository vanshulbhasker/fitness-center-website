				1st Model of Physical Fitness

			</h2>
			<br>

			<p>





			The definition of fitness can be expanded to incorporate a number of the essential elements which make up physical fitness.  Describing the key or essentials elements can identify other aspects of physical fitness for clarification. Fitness comprises a series of interrelated structural and functional factors which may be conveniently referred to as the basic S-factors of fitness (Verkhoshansky and Siff, 2009):
			<br>
			<ul2>
				<li>
					Strength
				</li>
				<li>
					Speed
				</li>
				<li>
					Stamina
				</li>
				<li>
					Suppleness
				</li>
				<li>
					Skill
				</li>
				<li>
					Style
				</li>
				<li>
					Structure
				</li>
				<li>
					Spirit
				</li>
			</ul2>
			<br>
			Unlike work capacity, fitness is described not simply by laboratory measurements of qualities such as cardiovascular function, muscle strength, and flexibility, but also by the specificity of fitness required for each activity or sport depending on neuromuscular skills.  
			<br>
			This first model is constructed from the functional motor elements of fitness. This model is divided into two stages: first, as a triangular model, which inter-relates strength, stamina (muscular endurance), speed, and flexibility and secondly, as a more complete and multi-level pyramidal model which interrelates all of these factors with the process which makes all movement possible, namely neuromuscular control or skill.
			<br>
			The below diagram corroborates the pyramid model (i.e. the Key Motor Abilities) depicting the various strength/motor qualities on a continuum that also relates to the sports continuum previous listed.
			<br>

			<br>
			<br>
			The pyramid diagram illustrates that strength, endurance, and flexibility may be produced statically or dynamically, unlike speed, which changes along a continuum from static (speed = 0) to the dynamic state.  
			<br><br>

			For this and other reasons, this model should be viewed as one which is representational or descriptive rather than scientifically analytical.

			<h2>
				The 2nd Model of Fitness

			</h2>
			<br>
			<p>
			The second model is the star diagram depicting the relationship between skill, strength, endurance, flexibility, and speed.
			<br>
			<br>

			<br>
			This diagram gives another perspective on the various categories of strength and how maximum strength is varied depending on the type of strength necessary for a specific event. 
			<br>
			Every activity has a primary and secondary type of strength utilized to achieve success in that activity or sport. Knowing which types of strength are necessary for success in a particular activity will enable coaches to optimize strength training.
			<br>
			Again, this diagram depicts categories of special strength that are trained after building a basic foundation of strength. This is analogous to building a house i.e. a foundation must be built first before walls. This also coincides with the Preparation Pyramid previously shown.
